Math script and similiar (Thinking about Math)
The intention of this fragment of a mathematics is to reflect on mathematics. It is not meant to be commercially exploitable. But it is about finding an easier access to mathematics. 
To give a small example: Numbers are interpreted as meta-symbols, which are therefore symbols of symbols. In my opinion, this makes the concept of numbers easier to learn. Perhaps this kind of definition can also be of help to people with dyscalculia, as their difficulties may be related to being able to imagine this additional level of abstraction. But this is only a guess.

So far, this Math Script is an introduction to what is called "naive logic". More pieces are to follow. The introduction is written in German. If necessary, an English translation can be made.

What is missing are exercises or learning games to practice or critique the contents of the script. 

If anyone is interested in working on the script, I (Markus Demarmels) would be very happy to hear from you.
