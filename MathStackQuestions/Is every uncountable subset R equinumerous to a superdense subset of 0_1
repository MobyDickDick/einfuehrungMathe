Is every uncountable subset of $\mathbb R$ equinumerous to a superdense subset of (0,1)?

This approach is based on minimal assumptions and avoids the axiom of choice (ZFC) and advanced measure-theoretic tools. Of course, it also avoids the continuum hypothesis.


If correct, this step would form part of a complete proof.

## **Definitions (for clarity)**

A set $M \subseteq (0,1)$ is **superdense** if
$$
\forall\, a,b \in (0,1),\; a < b\; \Rightarrow\; |M \cap (a,b)| > \aleph_0.
$$

The set $M$ is a **null set** (with respect to a naive outer measure $\kappa$) if
$$
\forall \varepsilon > 0,\; \exists \text{ open cover } U = \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} I_i \supseteq M \text{ with } \sum_i |I_i| < \varepsilon.
$$

## **Proof**

A compact perfect subset $K \subseteq M$ can be constructed recursively.

Begin with the full interval $(0,1)$. Since $M$ is superdense, four distinct points $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \in M$ can be selected such that $x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < x_4$ and
$$
x_2 - x_1 + x_4 - x_3 < \frac{2}{3}.
$$
These points define two closed intervals:  
$I_{1,1} := [x_1, x_2]$ and $I_{1,2} := [x_3, x_4]$.

Now proceed recursively:
- In each of the left and right thirds of every interval at generation $n$, choose two new points in $M$ to form subintervals contained in $M$, ensuring that the length is at most $\frac{2}{3}$ of the parent interval (as in the Cantor set construction, the middle third is excluded).
- Define $K_n := \bigcup_{k=1}^{2^n} I_{n,k}$.
- Let $K := \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty K_n$.

Then $K \subseteq M$, $K$ is closed (being a nested intersection of closed sets), bounded within $(0,1)$, and perfect (since every point is a limit point). Hence, $K$ is compact and perfect, so $K \sim \mathbb{R}$.

Since $K \subseteq M$, and $M \setminus K$ remains superdense and null set, the process may be repeated to construct disjoint compact perfect sets $K_n \subseteq M$, each equinumerous to $\mathbb{R}$.

Therefore:
$$
M \supseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} K_n \sim \mathbb{R}.
$$
