## Corollary: Canonical exhaustion for arbitrary subsets of $(0,1)$

As a consequence of the previous constructive $G_\delta$ representation, we may assert the following structural property of arbitrary subsets of $(0,1)$:

**Corollary.**  
For every subset $M \subset (0,1)$, there exists a countable family of disjoint compact sets $(K_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that:

- Each $K_n \subset (0,1)$,
- The union $\bigcup_{n} K_n$ **contains** all "essential" parts of $(0,1) \setminus M$ (in the sense of carrying its measure or cardinality),
- The complement satisfies:

$$
M = (0,1) \setminus \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} K_n = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n,
$$

where $U_n := (0,1) \setminus \bigcup_{k=1}^n K_k$.

We call this structure a **canonical exhaustion** of the complement of $M$.

This exhaustion is not unique, but it arises naturally from the classification of points in $M$ into three types:

1. Compact, measure-carrying parts,
2. Superdense but measure-zero parts,
3. Locally countable points.

Each of these can be approximated by compact disjoint sets, leading to a unified exhaustion of the entire complement.

### Remark.

This does *not* establish that every uncountable subset $M \subset (0,1)$ is equinumerous with $\mathbb{R}$ â€” this statement follows from an earlier, independent construction involving the superdense subset $M_4$ and bijective monotonic mappings.

Instead, this corollary serves as a **structural confirmation**: the "canonical exhaustion" that such bijections require actually exists, and can be constructed from first principles via compact approximations of each component.
