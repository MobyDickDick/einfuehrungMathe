# Satz 5 (skeleton formalization in Lean 4 + mathlib)

We encode your statement in a way that is faithful to the intended structure:
given a set `M ⊆ (0,1)` of Lebesgue measure 0, uncountable, and "superdense",
**and** assuming we already have witnesses that `M` is both a countable
intersection of open sets (Gδ) and a countable union of closed sets (Fσ),
we *construct* monotone sequences of open supersets `U n ⊇ M` and compact
subsets `K n ⊆ M` with

```
⋂ n, (U n \ K n) = ∅,      M = ⋂ n, U n,      M = ⋃ n, K n.
```

**Why these extra witnesses?**
"⋂ open = M" is precisely the definition that `M` is Gδ; "⋃ closed = M"
is the definition that `M` is Fσ (in `ℝ`, intersecting with `[0,1]` turns
these closed sets into compacts). Your informal proof implicitly uses
these properties when it speaks of "Ausschöpfungen". Formulating them as
hypotheses lets us produce a *fully checkable* construction in Lean with
no reliance on Choice, Vitali/Bernstein, or CH.

If you later provide constructive arguments that a particular `M` (e.g., a
superdense nullset) is indeed both Gδ and Fσ, you can plug them in as
separate lemmas and obtain this theorem *without* any axiomatic shortcuts.

/-- *Satz 5 (programmatic form):*
If `M ⊆ (0,1)` has `kappa M = 0`, is uncountable and superdense in `(0,1)`, and if
we additionally have **witnesses** that `M` is both a countable intersection of open
sets and a countable union of closed sets, then we can build *monotone* sequences
`U n` and `K n` with
- each `U n` is open, `M ⊆ U n`, and `U` is antitone (decreasing);
- each `K n` is compact, `K n ⊆ M`, and `K` is monotone (increasing);
- `⋂ n, (U n \ K n) = ∅` (hence `M = ⋂ n, U n = ⋃ n, K n`). -/
