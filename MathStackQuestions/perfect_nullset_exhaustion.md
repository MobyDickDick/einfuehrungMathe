# Can every perfect null set in $(0,1)$ be exhausted by countably many compact subsets?

**Question:**  
Let $M \subseteq (0,1)$ be a perfect set of Lebesgue measure zero, given constructively as the intersection of a decreasing sequence of sets  
$$
M = \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty C_k,
$$  
where each $C_k$ is a countable union of disjoint closed intervals with positive length:
$$
C_k = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty I_i^{(k)}, \quad I_i^{(k)} = [a_i^{(k)}, b_i^{(k)}] \subseteq (0,1),\quad b_i^{(k)} > a_i^{(k)}.
$$

Each $C_{k+1}$ is a subset of $C_k$, and the total length (or $\kappa$-measure) satisfies  
$$
\kappa(C_{k+1}) < \frac{1}{2} \kappa(C_k),
$$  
so that $\kappa(M) = 0$.

The question is:  
**Can $M$ be written as a countable union of compact sets $K_n \subseteq M$, i.e.,**
$$
M = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n,
$$  
**with each $K_n$ compact, and this union covering all points of $M$ (not just up to measure zero)?**

**Answer:**

Yes — under suitable construction, such a perfect null set $M$ can indeed be written as a **countable union of compact subsets** $K_n \subseteq M$ such that  
$$
M = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n,
$$  
in the **sense of cardinality**, i.e., every point of $M$ appears in some $K_n$ (not just "almost every" point).

### Construction Idea (Path-wise Exhaustion):

Each point $x \in M$ corresponds to a sequence of nested intervals  
$$
I_{i_1}^{(1)} \supset I_{i_2}^{(2)} \supset I_{i_3}^{(3)} \supset \cdots
$$  
such that $x \in \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty I_{i_k}^{(k)}$.

Such sequences define **paths** through the system of intervals. These paths can be identified (e.g.) by infinite binary sequences, if the interval trees are coded accordingly.

We now construct compact sets $K_n \subseteq M$ step by step as follows:

### Step-by-step Construction:

1. **Step 1:** Choose a finite collection of $2^1$ interval sequences (i.e., 2 binary prefixes of length 1), and take their nested intersections:
   $$
   K_1 := \bigcup_{\text{prefix } s \in \{0,1\}} \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} I_{s_k}^{(k)},
   $$
   where $s_k$ is the index determined by prefix $s$.

   $K_1$ is compact, as it is a finite union of closed sets.

2. **Step 2:** Define $M_2 := M \setminus K_1$, and build a new interval system $(C_k^{(2)})$ for $M_2$, again with $\kappa(C_k^{(2)}) \to 0$.

   From this, select $2^2 = 4$ new interval paths not yet covered, and build:
   $$
   K_2 := \bigcup_{\text{4 new prefixes}} \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} I_{i_k}^{(k,2)} \subseteq M_2.
   $$

3. **Continue inductively:** In step $n$, construct $M_n := M \setminus \bigcup_{j=1}^{n-1} K_j$  
   and define new interval systems $C_k^{(n)}$ such that
   $$
   M_n = \bigcap_k C_k^{(n)},
   $$
   and extract $2^n$ new paths to define $K_n$.

---

### Why this works (cardinal argument):

- Every point $x \in M$ corresponds to a path through the nested interval structure.
- There are uncountably many such paths.
- The binary code of each path can be matched to a finite prefix, which is eventually used in some $K_n$.
- Hence, **every point of $M$ lies in some $K_n$**, i.e.,
  $$
  M = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n.
  $$

Each $K_n$ is compact, and the union is countable ⇒ the exhaustion is complete.

---

### Conclusion:

Even though $M$ is not closed and has $\kappa(M) = 0$, we can still construct a **countable sequence of compact subsets** $K_n \subseteq M$ such that their union equals $M$ **in the cardinality sense** (not just up to measure zero).

This shows that perfect null sets can be **constructively and completely exhausted** by countably many compact subsets.
