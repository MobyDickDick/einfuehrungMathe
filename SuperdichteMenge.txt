Title: Is every subset of ℝ equinumerous to a superdense subset of (0,1)?

**Question:**  
Let us define a subset $S \subseteq (0,1)]$ to be *superdense* if it is uncountable and intersects every non-empty open subinterval $(a,b) \subseteq [0,1]$ with $a,b\in (0,1) \wedge a <b$ in uncountably many points.

> **Claim:** Every subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is equinumerous to a *superdense* subset of \([0,1]\).

This seems intuitively plausible:
- Since $\mathbb{R} \sim (0,1)$, and every $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\leq \mathfrak{c}$,
- one can inject $A$ into \([0,1]\),
- and potentially "spread out" the image of $A$ across many open intervals.

However:
- I have not seen this exact statement discussed in standard textbooks.
- Is this claim known or even trivial in descriptive set theory or topology?
- Does the image set $f(A) \subseteq [0,1]$ always admit a transformation into a *superdense* set (in the above sense), even if $A$ is strange (e.g. a Vitali set or Bernstein set)?
- Are there canonical examples for such embeddings?

**Definitions (for clarity):**  
Let's say a set $S \subseteq (0,1)$ is *superdense* if for every interval $(a,b) \subseteq [0,1]$ we have  

$$
|S \cap (a,b)| > \aleph_0.
$$
with $\aleph_0$ as the the cardinality of the natural numbers.

**Answer (constructive embedding):**  

Let A bet a uncoutable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and  $\psi: \mathbb{R} \to (0,1)$ be the bijection
$$
\psi(x) := \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 +  \frac{x}{\sqrt {x^2+1}}\right)
$$
This function is continuous, strictly increasing, and maps $\mathbb{R}$ bijectively onto $(0,1)$.

Now define
$$
B := \psi(A) \subseteq (0,1).
$$

Which must have the same cardinality as $A$
Let $(0,1)$ divide up into two different disjunct subsets of $(0,1)$ named $L$ (as "lean") and $F$ (as "fat"). For every point $x$ in $L$ it is true that there is an open Interval $I_x$ with the property 

$$
|I \cap B)| \leq  \aleph_0  \wedge \{\inf I, \sup I \}\subset \mathbb{Q}
$$

Define simply 
$$F := (0,1)\setminus L$$

Then $L$ must be an open set and therefore $F$ must be a closed set.
As there is only a countable number of such intervals $I$,  it must be true that 
$$
		|L| \leq \aleph_0
$$
Therefore, it can be concluded that
$$
		|F| > \aleph_0
$$
And it must be
 $$\left|F\right|=|A|$$ 

By construction, every single point $x\in F$ has to be a limit point. So $F$ is a perfect set and therefore bijective to (0,1). There must exist monotone and continuous function with maps $F$ subjectively to (0,1).

Perhaps the function $\Psi$ could start with
$$ 
  x_0 := \sup F \cap  \left( \inf F, \frac{\inf F + \sup F} {2}\right)
$$

As $F$ is a closed set and nonempty, this suprema must exist. Then let set

$$
\Psi(x_0):= \frac{1}{2}
$$

Moreover, by construction it must be true that. 

$$ 
   \left|F\cap \left( \inf F, \frac{\inf F + \sup F} {2}\right)\right| > \aleph_0
$$
as well as 
$$ 
\left|F\cap \left(\frac{\inf F + \sup F} {2}, \sup F\right)\right| > \aleph_0
$$

Therefore, the whole process can be started again. For every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ can be established points $x,y \in B$ with $x\neq y$ and
$$ 
\left|\Psi(x)-\Psi(y)\right| \leq 2^{-n}
$$
And by construction, this function has to be continuous and because the $F$ is closed, the image $\Psi\left( A\right)$ must also be closed. Therefore it can be concluded that 
$$
\Psi\left(F\right)=\left(0,1\right)
$$

Let  $S:=\Psi(F)$ and $(a,b) \subseteq (0,1)$ with $a<b$ be an arbitrary open interval. $S$ must be equonomerous to $F$ because only a countable number of point $x,y \in F$ can have the same image value under  the function$\Psi$. Let denote $\Phi$ the function with the property that $Phi(x)$ for all but at most countable number of  points in $F$ and $\Phi$ is bijective. Therefore, the new original set $F'$ is equonumerous to $F$ and therefore to $A$ and $S':= \Phi(F')$ is also equonumerous to $A$.
Since $\Phi$ is continuous and strictly increasing, the preimage $\Phi^{-1}((a,b)) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is also an open interval.
$$
F' \cap \Phi^{-1}((a,b))
$$
is uncountable. Because $F'$ is uncountable and if $(a,b) \cap \Phi^{-1}((a,b))$ would be empty, by construction of $\Phi$ it would be
$$
\Phi\left(a\right) = \Phi\left(b\right) 
$$
which would be a contraction to the construction of $\Phi$. But as there exists at least one single point $x\in F' \cap \Phi^{-1}((a,b))$, this means that 
$$
\left|F'\cap\Phi^{-1}((a,b))\right| > \aleph_0
$$

Then
$$
S' \cap (a,b) = \Phi(F \cap \Phi^{-1}((a,b)))
$$
is uncountable as well.

Thus, $S' \subseteq (0,1) \subseteq [0,1]$ is superdense and equinumerous to $A$.
